## Hardware Requirements

| Component | Model | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Microcontroller | **Arduino Mega 2560** | Must be Mega (not Uno) due to memory requirements |
| Network | **Arduino Ethernet Shield 2** | W5500 chipset, includes SD card slot |
| SDI Interface | **Blackmagic 3G-SDI Shield** | For Arduino, directly from Blackmagic |
| Storage | **MicroSD Card** | 1-32GB, must be formatted correctly (see below) |
| Power | **9-12V DC Power Supply** | Required - USB power alone is insufficient |

### Shield Stacking Order

```
        +---------------------+
    3   |  Blackmagic SDI     |  <- Top
        +---------------------+
    2   |  Ethernet Shield    |  <- Middle  
        +---------------------+
    1   |  Arduino Mega 2560  |  <- Bottom
        +---------------------+
```

### CRITICAL: I2C Bridge Wires Required

The Blackmagic SDI Shield is designed for Arduino Uno, which has I2C pins at A4/A5. The Arduino Mega has I2C on different pins (20/21), so you MUST add two jumper wires on the **Blackmagic SDI Shield**:

```
Bridge connections on SDI Shield:
  - A4 --> SCL
  - A5 --> SDA
```

These bridges route the I2C signals to the correct pins. Without them, the SDI shield will not communicate with the Arduino Mega.

### CRITICAL: External Power Required

The system requires external power (9-12V DC) connected to the Blackmagic SDI Shield's power input. USB power alone does not provide enough current and the system will fail to boot properly.

> **Note**: Starting with v3.7, if the system detects repeated boot failures (e.g., due to missing 12V power or invalid SDI signal), it will automatically enter Safe Mode. See [Safe Mode](#safe-mode) for details.

---

## SD Card Setup

### Partition and Format Requirements

The SD card MUST meet these requirements:

1. **MBR Partition Table** (not GPT) - Windows and Mac sometimes create GPT partitions
2. **Single Partition** - Only one partition on the card
3. **Correct Filesystem**:
   - Cards 2GB or smaller: FAT16
   - Cards 4GB or larger: FAT32
   - **exFAT will NOT work**

### Recommended Formatting Procedure

**Do NOT use Windows Explorer or Mac Disk Utility** - they may create incompatible partition tables.

Use the official SD Card Formatter from the SD Association:
1. Download from: https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/
2. Select your SD card
3. Choose "Overwrite format" (not quick format)
4. Format the card

If you still have issues, use the SdFormatter sketch included in the SdFat library examples.

### Copy Web Interface Files

After formatting, copy these files to the SD card root:

```
SD Card Root/
├── index.html      (Main CCU interface)
├── tally.html      (Tally configuration)
├── sdcard.html     (SD Card File manager)
└── safemode.html   (Safe Mode diagnostics - v3.7+)
```

## Safe Mode

Safe Mode is a recovery feature introduced in v3.7 that helps diagnose and recover from hardware-related boot failures.

### When Does Safe Mode Activate?

The system enters Safe Mode automatically after **3 consecutive boot failures**. Common causes:

1. **Missing 12V Power**: SDI Shield requires external 12V power
2. **Invalid SDI Signal**: 4K signals or Level A 3G-SDI are not supported
3. **SDI Cable Disconnected**: No signal during boot
4. **I2C Bus Conflict**: Missing or incorrect bridge wires

### What Works in Safe Mode?

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Web Interface | ✓ Available (diagnostic page) |
| Network Configuration | ✓ Available |
| vMix Tally Connection | ✓ Receive only (no SDI output) |
| Companion TCP | ✓ Available |
| Serial Console | ✓ Available |
| **SDI Tally Output** | ✗ Disabled |
| **CCU Camera Control** | ✗ Disabled |

### Exiting Safe Mode

1. **Fix the underlying issue** (connect 12V power, valid SDI signal, etc.)
2. Access the diagnostic page at `http://YOUR_ARDUINO_IP/`
3. Click **"Restart Normal Mode"**
4. The system will restart and attempt normal boot

Alternatively, use the serial command `normalboot` to exit Safe Mode.

### Manual Safe Mode Entry

For testing or troubleshooting, you can force Safe Mode on the next boot:
- Serial command: `safemode`
- The system will enter Safe Mode on the next restart

## Bitfocus Companion Module

### Installation

1. Copy `companion-module/` to Companion's dev modules directory
2. Run `yarn install` inside the folder
3. In Companion Settings, set developer modules path
4. Add connection: "TallyCCU Pro"

### Actions Available

- All CCU parameters (set/increase/decrease/reset)
- Load/Save presets
- Change active camera
- vMix connection toggle

### Real-Time Sync

The Companion module automatically syncs with the web interface:
- Parameters changed in Companion are instantly reflected in the web UI
- Parameters changed in the web UI are instantly reflected in Companion variables
- When either client connects, it receives the current state from the other

---

## TCP Protocol (Port 8098)

For custom integrations, connect via TCP to port 8098.

---

## Memory Usage

TallyCCU Pro is optimized for Arduino Mega's limited 8KB RAM:
- Static buffers (no String objects in critical paths)
- SSE-based sync (state stored in browser, not Arduino)
- Efficient TCP handling with connection pooling
- Typical free RAM: ~2,000+ bytes (improved in v3.7.1)

---

## Limitations

### HTTPS Not Supported
The Arduino Mega cannot handle HTTPS connections due to hardware limitations (insufficient RAM and CPU for TLS encryption). Always use `http://` when accessing the web interface.

> **Tip**: If your browser defaults to HTTPS and shows a connection error, manually type `http://` before the IP address.

### SDI Shield Resolution & Signal Limitations
The Blackmagic 3G-SDI Arduino Shield has the following limitations:
- **Maximum resolution**: 1080p60 (no 4K/UHD support)
- **3G-SDI Level B only**: The shield only passes video when using 3G-SDI Level B. This is the default for Blackmagic devices, but other manufacturers may default to Level A. Check your camera/device settings if video is not passing through.

### Single SSE Client
Only one SSE connection is supported at a time. Multiple browser tabs will share the same connection, but opening the interface on multiple devices simultaneously may cause sync issues.

### Network Connections
The Arduino Ethernet library supports a maximum of 4 simultaneous TCP connections, shared between:
- HTTP requests (web interface)
- SSE connection (real-time sync)
- TCP clients (Companion, custom integrations)
- vMix connection (tally)

### Camera Protocol
The Blackmagic SDI protocol is **write-only** - parameters can be sent to cameras but not read back. The system cannot query current camera settings; it only knows values that were set through TallyCCU Pro.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Web interface not loading | Verify SD card is MBR/FAT16 or FAT32, reformat with SD Association tool |
| SDI shield not responding | Check I2C bridge wires (A4→SCL, A5→SDA on SDI shield) |
| System not booting | Connect external 9-12V power, USB is insufficient |
| System stuck in boot loop | Check 12V power and SDI signal; after 3 failures, Safe Mode activates automatically |
| Safe Mode activated | Fix hardware issue (12V power, valid SDI signal), then click "Restart Normal Mode" |
| vMix tally not working | Verify vMix IP in tally.html, check vMix TCP API is enabled |
| Camera not responding | Verify camera ID matches, check SDI connection and termination |
| Browser shows HTTPS error | Type `http://` explicitly before the IP address |
| Sync not working | Ensure both web and Companion are connected; check serial monitor for SSE status |
| Settings reset after reboot | Resolved in v3.5+; update firmware if running an older version |
| Controls not working on tablet | Requires v3.7.1+ which adds touch support for knobs, wheels, and joystick |
